# What is this?

This is a small and simple command line tool which can help you add a license file
to your repo and can be useful when automating that task.

# How do I run this?

You need to have [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) installed and then just type `cargo run` in the same
folder where `Cargo.toml` is located.

Alternatively this might be published on [crates.io](https://crates.io)

# How do I use this?

This utility has a simple enough `--help` argument which will print out what you can do with it.

Here's a simple example: `licenz --license mit --copyright "Jane Doe"`.
